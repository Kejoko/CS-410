----- COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS -----
1. Open a terminal and `cd` into the directory containing the contents of the tar
   file (the directory with the contents of "KeeganKochis01.tar")
2. Run the command 'mkdir build; cd build`
	* We will compile in the "build" directory in order to prevent cmake and make
	  from polluting the top level directory
	* Note that this step is not necessary. If you choose to not do this step there
	  are additional details under the next step on how to move forward
3. Run the command `cmake ..`
	* The `..` denotes that "CMakeLists.txt" is in the directory one level above
	  your current directory (one level above the "build" directory)
	* If you chose to not use the "build" directory and are still operating in
	  the top level directory, run the command `cmake .` instead
4. Run the command `make`
5. You should see the "render" executable in your current directory

----- EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS -----
1. Once the "render" executable has been built, using the steps above, `mv` or `cp`
   the "render" executable into the directory containing all of the obj models
	* This allows the "render" executable to access these models
	* The solution files (the updated obj files and txt files containing the
	  transformation matrix information) generated by the "render" executable
	  will appear in the folder containing the modelsb and the "render" executable
2. `cd` into the directory containing the models and the "render" executable
3. Run the "render" executable by running the command `./render <path_to_driver>`
	* Note that `<path_to_driver>` should be replaced with the path
	  containing the desired driver file.
	* Example: `./render ../drivers/driver00.txt`
	* Example: `./render ~/Documents/cs410/drivers/driver06.txt`
4. The resulting files  will be in the same directory as the
  "render" executable
